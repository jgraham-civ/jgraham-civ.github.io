        <p><b>Tikal:</b></p>
        <p>The Maya civilisation was a collection of city states with a shared culture and related languages, more akin to Ancient Greece than the centralised empire of Ancient Rome. Of these, Chichen Itza, in Mexico, is one of the most famous. The city's historical power and impressive showcasing of Mayan engineering, astronomy, religion, and cultural practices has earned Chichen Itza status as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.</p>
        <p>Lesser known is the Mayan city of Tikal, whose ruins are nestled deep in the jungle an hour’s drive north of Flores, Guatemala.</p>
        <p>Like Chichén Itzá, Tikal was a major urban centre in pre-Columbian Mayan civilisation, though the zenith of its influence came earlier than the former and was more in line with that of Mayan civilisation as a whole. Through war, trade, and diplomacy, it rose to dominate the region and grew to an estimated population of 90,000. Chief among its adversaries was not Chichen Itza, but Calakmul (in modern day Mexico), and power swung between them in a fierce, centuries-long rivalry.</p>
        <p>The vegetation that has since reclaimed Tikal also gives it a starkly different atmosphere to Chichen Itza. Spider monkeys and coatis roam freely here, and getting between the many temples takes you along dense jungle trails. The top of Temple V offers a jaw-dropping panorama of the other temples rising above the tree canopy. Centuries ago there would have been no canopy to rise above-- streets and farmland would have spread in every direction-- but the view as it is now remains spectacular and was used by George Lucas used to shoot the arrival of the Millenium Falcon on Yavin IV in Star Wars: A New Hope. As someone who grew up on Star Wars, I am biased, but Tikal a must-visit.</p>

        <p><b>Caye Caulker:</b></p>
        <p>Belize is the black sheep of Central American countries. It is bordered by Mexico to the north, and Guatemala to the south and west, but claims a more Caribbean than Latin identity due in part to its status as a former British slave colony. Today, Belize is a melting pot of cultures, languages and ethnicities, with substantial populations of Mayan, African, East Asian, and even Mennonite (Amish) Belizeans.</p>
        <p>Caye Caulker feels particularly Caribbean. Belizean Creole and afrobeat music are heard everywhere, ‘Rude Boy’ — a vodka-based drink with caffeine, ginseng and natural aphrodisiacs— lines the shelves of all stores, and Jerk Chicken is top of the menu at every food outlet.</p>

        <p><b>Cartagena:</b></p>
        <p>As a hub for the export of Bolivian silver and for the import of African slaves, Cartagena grew rapidly in both wealth and strategic importance throughout the colonial era; before long, everyone wanted a piece of it. The Museo Naval del Caribe chronicles the incessant raids, sieges, and bombardments of the city at the hands of navies and pirates from England (surprise!), France, and the Netherlands, while the several dozen miniatures of forts and battlements (some still standing, but many more destroyed) illustrate the lengths taken to protect it.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Colombia's Cartagena is the jewel of its Carribbean coast. Its beautifully preserved pastel fascades, typical of Spanish colonial architecture, attract tourists from far and wide. Next to the old walled city is the much-gentrified neighbourhood of Getsemani, where at night bars and clubs spill out onto narrow streets, serving strong cocktails to pedestrians jostling with food stalls and busking dancers for space. The foot-traffic is insane.</p>

        <p><b>Medellin:</b></p>
        <p>Following several decades of crippling violence at the bloody hands of cartels and paramilitary groups, the City of Eternal Spring has experienced a dramatic revival of which the residents are rightfully proud. From the new metro system, cable car lines, and giant EPM Public Library, to the transformation of Comuna 13 into a vibrant arts and music hub, evidence of this resurgence can be seen everywhere. Besides the dense mountainside barrios, the city is also extremely green. In academic circles, Medellin is viewed as a poster child for modern urban development.</p>
        <p>We were kept very busy during our week here. We soaked up the atmosphere of downtown and Comuna 13 on guided tours, watched the country’s largest football club (Atletico Nacional) play at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium (the lungs on their ultras!), and sampled the city’s nightlife— active Monday through Sunday.</p>

        <p><b>Salento:</b></p>
        <p>Salento is a quaint town in the heart of Colombia’s Eje Cafetero (Coffee Axis) region, popular among tourists for its colourful colonial houses, coffee estates, and proximity to the Cocora Valley.</p>
        <p>The uncontested highlight of our short stay here was our hike around the aforementioned Cocora Valley. From Salento’s central square, we hopped on the back of a 4x4 which took us 20 minutes to the hike’s start point. Besides being maybe the greenest place I’ve ever been, here one can find Colombia’s famous wax palms. These trees are extremely tall (regularly growing to heights of 45m), but their trunks and leaves grow no larger than any normal palm tree, making them appear comically thin and veritably alien. Our hike took us up into the mountains for stunning vistas and back into the valley below along a stream criss-crossed by rope bridges.</p>

        <p><b>Lima:</b></p>
        <p>I regret that I didn’t better explore Peru’s sprawling capital, though its size makes it difficult to see fully; with over 10 million residents, it is the second largest city in the Americas.</p>
        <p>In the heart of the Miraflores district we visited the mysterious  archaeological complex, previously a ceremonial and administrative centre of the pre-Incan “Lima Culture”. The 22-metre-high staggered pyramid and the surrounding urban zones are all built of adobe bricks. Dating back to around 400 CE, not much is known about the site or the Lima Culture who constructed it.</p>
        <p><b>Ica:</b></p>
        <p>After five days in Lima we caught a bus south along Peru’s puninishingly arid Pacific coast towards the city of Ica. Ica is only a short way inland, pressed up against the Ica desert to the southwest. Here, dust turns to sand and forms dunes up to 200 metres high. Tucked away amongst them is the Huacachina oasis, a popular backpackers' retreat.</p>

        <p><b>Paracas:</b></p>
        <p>It is hard to put to paper how impressive and other-worldly the landscape of the Paracas National Reserve is. It might be lazy to describe it as looking like Mars, but standing at any viewpoint that is truly how it feels. It is dry, it is rocky, and there is not a single tree, shrub, or blade of grass as far as the eye can see. And yet, the ocean surrounding it is incredibly nutrient-rich and biodiverse, supporting approximately 200 species of seabirds, several marine mammals, sharks, and the fish on which they feed.</p>
        <p>Nearby are the Ballestas Islands, a group of small, rocky islands whose cliffs, arches, and outcrops cut razor-sharp outlines. The islands provide sanctuary to enormous colonies of Guanay cormorants, Peruvian boobies, Humboldt penguins, fur seals and sea lions (to name a few).</p>
        <p>Real estate on the Ballestas Islands is scarce, and such dense bird populations produce large amounts of guano (bird excrement). Guano used to be highly coveted as a crop fertiliser from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s—before the invention of synthetic substitutes. The terrain is still scattered with rusty and weathered mining infrastructure erected to capitalise on the demand. Such extensive mining severely damaged the natural environment until measures were taken in the early 1900s to limit extraction and protect the islands’ wildlife. Some mining still occurs today, but is highly regulated. Rather, the islands have become more important as a tourist attraction and as sites of scientific research.</p>
        <p><b>Arequipa:</b></p>
        <p>Arequipa has one of the most beautiful old towns—and the most beautiful central plaza—of any city we visited on this trip. The entire district, including its churches, banks, cafes, museums, and the massive Basilica Cathedral, is constructed from sillar, a white volcanic rock that gives the city a brilliant architectural consistency as well as its nickname (“The White City”).</p>
        <p>On our second day here we visited the Santa Catalina Monastery. Despite being in the heart of Arequipa, this walled citadel remained entirely disconnected from the city for 391 years before being opened to the public in 1970. Prior to this, contact was limited to the passing of provisions and notes through a handful of small rotating doors.</p>
        <p>Due to frequent earthquakes the monastery has undergone many reconstructions, extensions, and modifications, existing today as a kind of labyrinth of corridors, vaults, sleeping quarters, courtyards, archways, and prayer rooms. Where most of the old town leaves the natural off-white colour of sillar as is, entire sections of the monastery have been coated with blocks of orange and royal blue dyes. Painted onto the walls surrounding the courtyards are still life and religious scenes, while the interiors are filled out with framed paintings and simple furniture. The monastery is complete with outdoor washing basins and a small garden, in which we felt very much isolated from the city around us.</p>
        <p>The nuns which have long lived here are an alarmingly devout bunch. Wall-mounted placards talk of the nuns’ practices, which included (of course) plenty of silent prayer and meditation, but also fasting, sleep deprivation, adopting uncomfortable postures, and wearing “barbed-wire undergarments”. By “maintaining the body with the minimum necessary to prevent its collapse”, the nuns sought to achieve a “mystic betrothal” with Christ. Nowadays, 21 sisters aged between 25 and 100 live in a small, closed-off section of the monastery. I hope they are not still taking themselves to such extremes!</p>

        <p><b>The Red Valley:</b></p>
        <p>The Red Valley lies deep in the Andes, a four hour drive from Cusco and a further hour's hike from the nearest road, though at 5000 metres, the hike feels longer than that.</p>
        <p>The mountain peaks and soil around them are a dull taupe colour but transition into a deep red as you follow the slopes down into the valley. Large parts of the valley floor are covered in a lime green moss and dotted with grazing vicunas.</p>

        <p><b>La Paz:</b></p>
        <p>Flowing through a canyon between the Altiplano plateau and the Cordillera Real mountain range, its unique topography has created an amazing cityscape that can be admired from almost any angle. The best way do to this is with Mi Teleférico, the cable car and mass transit system which serves the city. My friends and I spent an afternoon with our noses pressed against the cable car windows, going nowhere in particular and having a brilliant time.</p>
        <p>At street level the city is considerably more chaotic. Minivans belch out diesel fumes millimetres from pedestrians jostling for limited pavement space, currency exchanges trade US dollars for black market rates, and on their commutes, high-earning city businesspeople stroll right past the bullet-ridden doors of the city’s largest prison.</p>
        <p>Anyone who visits Bolivia will also notice many indigenous Aymara and Quechua women, known as cholitas, wearing pleated, puffed skirts (known as polleras), shawls, and (typically) bowler hats, with their hair tied into two long braids. Historically marginalised, cholitas were barred from certain public spaces, given limited career opportunities, and prohibited from taking public transport. Their civil rights movement, ongoing since the 60s, has made significant progress following Evo Morales’ 2006 election as Bolivia’s first indigenous president. Nowadays, cholitas work as teachers, bus drivers, business owners, politicians, journalists, and even… wrestlers? One of the more bizarre cultural phenomena to have emerged from La Paz pits cholitas against one another in choreographed matches, performing throws, holds, and jumps (including one from a viewing balcony) straight out of the WWE playbook. It was an awesome spectacle to witness firsthand.</p>
        <p>While inequality remains—many of the beggars we saw were cholitas—it is encouraging to learn about their rise as prominent cultural and professional figures.</p>
        <p>La Paz is not an architectural marvel. What it is, however, is a city so constantly active and rich with lore that you can’t help but be absorbed by it. It has to be said that much of the city's excitement for backpackers is rooted in a long-struggling economy: From the corruption of San Pedro prison to the US dollar black market, to the strikes against fuel subsidy cuts—these reflect a country in need of change, and I do hope Bolivia finds greener pastures in the years to come.</p>
