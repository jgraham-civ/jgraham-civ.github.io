  <h2>MSc Bioinformatics Graduate</h2>

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Edinburgh in 2024. A year later, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Master of Science in Bioinformatics. I was awarded First-Class Honours and a Distinction in my bachelor’s and master’s, respectively.

Along the way, I have gained industry experience as an intern at Oxford-based biotech company [Moa Technology](https://www.moa-technology.com/), and in a research environment as an intern at the [University of Edinburgh](https://biology.ed.ac.uk/immunology-infection).

My training spans statistics, machine learning, and data analysis, as well as Python, R, and Bash programming. I am comfortable applying these skills to large-scale datasets to tackle complex biological questions, and have worked on projects in infectious disease epidemiology, structural bioinformatics, protein analysis, and genomics.

Having grown up between Australia, Hong Kong, and the UK, I am now based in Sydney and looking to further my training while contributing to applied biomedical and public health research. 

This site serves as a space to showcase my work, share selected projects, and explore my broader interests.
