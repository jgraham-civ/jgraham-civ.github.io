  <h1>Jake Graham</h1>
  <h2>MSc Bioinformatics Graduate</h2>
</div>

<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Edinburgh in 2024. A year later, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Master of Science in Bioinformatics. I was awarded First-Class Honours and a Distinction in my bachelor’s and master’s, respectively.</p>

<p>Along the way, I have gained industry experience as an intern at Oxford-based biotech company <a href="https://www.moa-technology.com/">Moa Technology</a>, and in a research environment as an intern at the <a href="https://biology.ed.ac.uk/immunology-infection">University of Edinburgh</a>.</p>

<p>My training spans statistics, machine learning, and data analysis, as well as Python, R, and Bash programming. I am comfortable applying these skills to large-scale datasets to tackle complex biological questions, and have worked on projects in infectious disease epidemiology, structural bioinformatics, protein analysis, and genomics.</p>

<p>Having grown up between Australia, Hong Kong, and the UK, I am now based in Sydney and looking to further my training while contributing to applied biomedical and public health research.</p>

<p>This site serves as a space to showcase my work, share selected projects, and explore my broader interests.</p>
